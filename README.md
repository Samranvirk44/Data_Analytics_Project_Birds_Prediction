In the ICT5013 Data Analytics/Statistics course, as part of our MSIT (Data Science & AI) program, we analyzed bird species diversity across eight zones in Australia using flight height, habitat types, and geographic coordinates. Our study involved exploring data distributions, handling outliers, and applying models like Decision Trees, Multiple Linear Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) to address three key questions: predicting bird species, examining the relationship between flight height and habitat, and assessing the impact of geographic data on species prediction. Through this analysis, we gained insights into bird behavior and habitat preferences, highlighting the need for additional predictors to enhance model accuracy and support ecological conservation efforts.
